About
=====

sugar-build is a set of scripts to build sugar from sources. Please read the [documentation](http://sugarlabs.org/~buildbot/docs/build.html).

Hacking
=======

If you need to make changes to osbuild, you can clone the module

    git clone git://github.com/dnarvaez/osbuild.git

Install it for your user

    python setup.py install --user

And the run the commands directly instead of using the osbuild script

    ./commands/shell
